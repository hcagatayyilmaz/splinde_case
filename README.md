# Details

So in this case, I used Next.js for fullstack development of the platform. Since the case is mostly about client-side rendering, I think a single endpoint which fetches data is enough. So I chose Next.js which is a fullstack framework using React and TypeScript. So it is satisfying the requirements. Also the app is containerized and added to docker-compose file in a simplistic setup.

Detail of development: for design I used shadcn as component library since it enables us to import specific components without need to import the whole library. It has a tree view component which I used as UI component inside TreeView custom component. It supports the following features. The whole design is responsive. Rendering is client-side heavy so there is no persistent data storage including database, local storage or session storage. I used Context API for state management.

  Update Value

  Delete Entry
- User can delete entry
  Update UI
- For each change, UI is expected to automatically update with new change.
